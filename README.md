# 游삖 Sentiment Searcher App 游늳 - Team 3dPy 游꿡

## Overview 游닇

**We only used `open source` data and tools for this project**

This repository contains the work of Team 3dPy, for the Sony PlayStation Hackathon. The focus is on performing sentiment analysis of PlayStation-related blog posts and social media content. The data used in this project is publicly available and it's acquisition generally complies with all relevant web scraping guidelines and robots.txt files. Also, this was fun 游땏. Not breaking any laws here 游뚭

### Project Objective 游꿢

To conduct sentiment analysis of public posts and comments from various social media sites. This analysis centers around PlayStation-related content (games, posts, features, consoles, subscriptions, etc), providing insights into public sentiment and engagement. We use the natural language toolkit (NLTK) to perform sentiment analysis on the data. The results are then visualized using matplotlib and renders in our app.  

### Data Collection 游늵

The data for this project was collected from the following sources:

- PlayStation Blog 游릭
- Reddit 游릭
- Metacritic 游릭
- IGN 游릭


**Notes:** *We didn't have funds to pay larger social medial sites thousands of dollars for a developer account to use their APIs, so we only went back 1 calendar year, to not scrape too much of their data. We wanted to respect their data collection, while still being able to enjoy the challenge of a good ol' Hackathon.*

*We also batched the requests to not overload any services. Plus, we are only talking about > 100 mbs of data, so it's not like we are scraping the entire internet.* 游땔
